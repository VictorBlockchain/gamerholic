### **Smart Contract Design for NFT Ecosystem on Solana**

#### **Overview**
Create a suite of upgradable smart contracts on Solana to manage a decentralized NFT ecosystem with the following components:
1. **Labels**: 1-of-1 NFTs representing collections.
2. **Operator Licenses**: Limited-transfer licenses allowing team members to mint and manage NFTs under a Label.
3. **Marketplace Licenses**: Transferable licenses enabling users to sell NFTs under a specific Label.
4. **NFTs**: Standard NFTs linked to a single Label.
5. **Vaults**: Attached to 1-of-1 NFTs and Labels for storing assets (SOL, tokens, or NFTs) with time-locking functionality.
6. **Shop**: A marketplace for listing, buying, and selling NFTs with redistribution and platform fees.
7. **Admin Contract**: Manages platform-wide settings (e.g., platform address, service fee).

---

### **Key Features and Rules**

#### **1. Labels**
   - Labels are 1-of-1 NFTs with metadata (name, description, image).
   - Must be manually renewed with a 7-day grace period after expiration.
   - Expired Labels can be purchased by anyone, and all linked Operator Licenses must be unlinked.
   - Labels can be transferred or sold. New owners must be updated in the system.
   - Labels can be linked to other Labels, but no circular linking is allowed.
   - Linking Labels does not create a parent-child relationship (e.g., Label A linked to Label B does not give Label B control over Label A).

#### **2. Operator Licenses**
   - Minted by Label owners and linked to a specific Label.
   - Limited transfer: Can only be transferred back to the Label owner or burn address.
   - Roles:
     - Role = 1: Super Admin (can mint new Labels, Operator Licenses, and assign/revoke roles).
     - Other roles: Custom permissions (e.g., minting NFTs).
   - Expiration:
     - Licenses expire automatically, revoking all permissions (existing and future actions).
     - Expiration dates can be updated by the Label owner or Super Admin.
   - Changes to roles or expiration dates are logged via events.

#### **3. Marketplace Licenses**
   - Minted by Label owners and linked to a specific Label.
   - Transferable and can be sold multiple times.
   - Expiration:
     - Expired licenses prevent new listings but do not delist existing ones.
     - Expiration dates can be updated by the Label owner or Super Admin.
   - Allows holders to sell NFTs under the linked Label.

#### **4. NFTs**
   - Standard NFTs linked to a single Label.
   - Only Label owners or Super Admin Operator License holders can mint NFTs.
   - Metadata and attributes are immutable after minting.
   - NFTs cannot be linked to multiple Labels.

#### **5. Vaults**
   - Automatically created for 1-of-1 NFTs and Labels.
   - Only the NFT or Label owner can withdraw assets.
   - Time locks:
     - Can be set for specific assets or the entire vault.
     - Time locks can be updated multiple times, as long as the new date is in the future.
   - Vault addresses are public, allowing anyone to deposit assets (no deposit function needed).

#### **6. Label Vaults**
   - Accessed by Label owners or Operator License holders.
   - Custom withdrawal rules can be set for each Operator License (e.g., limit SOL withdrawals to 0.3 every 7 days).
   - Label owners can override Super Admin withdrawal restrictions.
   - All withdrawal actions are logged via events.

#### **7. Shop**
   - Allows users to list, buy, and sell NFTs.
   - Payment methods: SOL or a specific SPL token (can be updated dynamically).
   - Redistribution:
     - 3% of sales is redistributed equally among all NFT holders in the Label.
   - Platform fee:
     - Deducted before redistribution.
     - Adjustable via the Admin Contract.
   - Efficient redistribution mechanism (no gas-intensive loops).

#### **8. Search**
   - Returns all NFTs linked to a Label, including metadata (via IPFS) and sale status.
   - Front-end handles pagination and filtering.

#### **9. Admin Contract**
   - Manages platform-wide settings:
     - Platform address.
     - Service fee (adjustable).
   - Admin privileges:
     - Inherited by the platform Label owner.
     - Upgradability restricted to the platform Label owner.

#### **10. General**
   - **Security**:
     - Prevent reentrancy attacks.
     - Ensure proper access control (e.g., validate Operator License expiration and Label registration status).
   - **Gas Optimization**:
     - Critical for minting and shop interactions (e.g., efficient redistribution).
   - **Events**:
     - Emit events for all key actions (e.g., minting, transferring, role updates).
   - **Testing**:
     - Use Anchor framework on Devnet for testing.

---

### **Additional Clarifications**
1. **Redistribution Calculation**:
   - 3% of sales is split equally among all NFT holders in the Label.
2. **Platform Fee**:
   - Deducted before redistribution.
3. **Label Linking**:
   - NFTs under Label A cannot be sold in Label B’s marketplace.
4. **Vault Time Lock**:
   - Deposits are unrestricted (vault address is public).
5. **Operator License Expiration**:
   - All actions (existing and future) are revoked upon expiration.

This prompt should cover all the details needed to restart the conversation or share the design with others. Let me know if you need further adjustments!

To implement **static reflections** (payment distribution among holders without a gas-consuming loop), we can use a **deferred claims** mechanism. Instead of distributing payments immediately to all holders (which would require a loop and be gas-intensive), we can track each holder's share of the redistribution and allow them to withdraw their balance at their convenience. Here's how this can be implemented:

---

### **Key Components**

1. **Accumulated Redistribution Balance**:
   - Store the total amount of SOL or tokens to be redistributed in the shop contract.
   - Track the amount each holder is entitled to using a mapping or account-based system.

2. **Per-Holder Redistribution Tracking**:
   - For each holder, store their **accumulated balance** (the amount they are owed but haven't withdrawn yet).
   - Update this balance whenever a sale occurs under their Label.

3. **Withdrawal Function**:
   - Allow holders to withdraw their accumulated balance at any time.
   - Reset their balance to zero after withdrawal.

4. **Efficient Redistribution Calculation**:
   - Instead of looping through all holders, calculate the share for each holder based on their ownership stake at the time of the sale.
   - Update their accumulated balance in constant time (O(1)).

---

### **Implementation Steps**

#### **1. Data Structures**
Define the following data structures in the shop contract:

```rust
// Pseudocode for Solana
struct ShopState {
    total_redistribution: u64, // Total SOL/tokens to be redistributed
    platform_fee: u64,         // Platform fee percentage
    redistribution_fee: u64,   // Redistribution percentage (3%)
    redistribution_token: Pubkey, // SPL token address for payments
}

struct HolderBalance {
    accumulated_balance: u64, // Amount owed to the holder
}

// Mapping to store each holder's balance
// Key: Holder's public key, Value: HolderBalance
holder_balances: HashMap<Pubkey, HolderBalance>;
```

---

#### **2. Redistribution Logic**
When an NFT is sold:
1. Calculate the redistribution amount (3% of the sale price).
2. Deduct the platform fee (if applicable).
3. Distribute the redistribution amount equally among all holders of NFTs linked to the Label.

```rust
// Pseudocode for redistribution logic
fn process_sale(sale_amount: u64, label: Pubkey) {
    // Deduct platform fee
    let platform_fee = sale_amount * shop_state.platform_fee / 100;
    let remaining_amount = sale_amount - platform_fee;

    // Calculate redistribution amount (3%)
    let redistribution_amount = remaining_amount * shop_state.redistribution_fee / 100;

    // Distribute equally among holders
    let num_holders = get_num_holders(label); // Get number of holders for the Label
    let share_per_holder = redistribution_amount / num_holders;

    // Update each holder's accumulated balance
    for holder in get_holders(label) {
        let holder_balance = holder_balances.entry(holder).or_insert(HolderBalance { accumulated_balance: 0 });
        holder_balance.accumulated_balance += share_per_holder;
    }

    // Update total redistribution balance
    shop_state.total_redistribution += redistribution_amount;
}
```

---

#### **3. Withdrawal Function**
Allow holders to withdraw their accumulated balance:

```rust
// Pseudocode for withdrawal function
fn withdraw_balance(holder: Pubkey) {
    let holder_balance = holder_balances.get_mut(&holder).expect("Holder not found");

    // Ensure the holder has a balance to withdraw
    assert!(holder_balance.accumulated_balance > 0, "No balance to withdraw");

    // Transfer the balance to the holder
    let amount_to_withdraw = holder_balance.accumulated_balance;
    transfer_funds(holder, amount_to_withdraw);

    // Reset the holder's balance
    holder_balance.accumulated_balance = 0;

    // Update total redistribution balance
    shop_state.total_redistribution -= amount_to_withdraw;
}
```

---

#### **4. Efficient Holder Tracking**
To avoid looping through all holders during redistribution:
- Use a **snapshot mechanism** to track the number of holders and their stakes at the time of the sale.
- Store the number of holders and their addresses in a separate data structure (e.g., a list or account).

```rust
// Pseudocode for holder snapshot
struct LabelState {
    holders: Vec<Pubkey>, // List of holders for the Label
    num_holders: u64,     // Number of holders
}

fn get_num_holders(label: Pubkey) -> u64 {
    let label_state = label_states.get(&label).expect("Label not found");
    label_state.num_holders
}

fn get_holders(label: Pubkey) -> Vec<Pubkey> {
    let label_state = label_states.get(&label).expect("Label not found");
    label_state.holders.clone()
}
```

---

### **Advantages of This Approach**
1. **Gas Efficiency**:
   - No loops are required during sales or redistribution.
   - Each holder's balance is updated in constant time (O(1)).

2. **Deferred Claims**:
   - Holders can withdraw their balance at any time, reducing the need for immediate transfers.

3. **Scalability**:
   - Works efficiently even with a large number of holders.

4. **Transparency**:
   - Holders can check their accumulated balance at any time.

---

### **Example Workflow**
1. **NFT Sale**:
   - NFT is sold for 100 SOL.
   - Platform fee (e.g., 2%) = 2 SOL.
   - Redistribution amount (3%) = 2.94 SOL.
   - If there are 10 holders, each holder's balance increases by 0.294 SOL.

2. **Holder Withdrawal**:
   - Holder A calls `withdraw_balance`.
   - Holder A receives their accumulated balance (e.g., 1.5 SOL).
   - Their balance is reset to 0.

---

### **Edge Cases to Handle**
1. **Zero Holders**:
   - If no holders exist, the redistribution amount is retained in the shop contract.

2. **Small Redistribution Amounts**:
   - Ensure that rounding errors do not lead to loss of funds (e.g., use fixed-point arithmetic).

3. **Holder Changes**:
   - If a holder sells their NFT, their accumulated balance remains until withdrawn.
